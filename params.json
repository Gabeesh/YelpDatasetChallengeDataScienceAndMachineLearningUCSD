In our data analysis, we've determined the difficulty in predicting user's review stars given the reviews they left as well as provided our best model and added in a few visualizations for fun.\r\n\r\n### Data Wrangling\r\nThe first thing we noticed that the Reviews table was large so we divided into quarters. Then we simply sampled the first quarter of the Reviews and inner-joined it with the key-ids from Tips, Users, and Businesses table and ended up with the TURBO dataset with 37K records (**T**ips, **U**sers, **R**eviews, **O**nly). We later on use the Checkins table in order to find the top businesses in our similarity matrix visualization.\r\n\r\n### Exploratory Data Analysis\r\n<img src=\"turkey.png\" alt=\"Yelpers' Thanksgiving WordCloud\" class=\"inline\"/>\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Henry Qiu (@heqiu)\r\n* \r\n* Ken Tien (\r\n*\r\n* Kevin Hung (@kevin11h)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
